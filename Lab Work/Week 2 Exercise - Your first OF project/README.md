Through this assignment, I mainly mastered the folder structure of files of openframeworks and how to create and edit these files. Also by rewriting the image project of last semester, I reviewed the pixel related knowledge.  
In this project, first of all, I changed all the colors in this painting into their corresponding opposite colors. Then the color displayed in the painting is controlled by changing of the mouse horizontal coordinate position.
