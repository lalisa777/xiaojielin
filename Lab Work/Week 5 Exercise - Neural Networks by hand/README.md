# Week 5 Exercise - Neural Networks by hand

This lab is mainly completed by learning the materials provided by GitHub and aided by Andrew Ng's mechanical learning. The construction of the neural network is also based on an exercise after the course: suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant, considering opening a branch store, and predicting its profit according to the population data of the city. It also uses a mini data set provided by him: population data corresponding to different cities and profits.
 
## What did I learn?
### Mathematics
  The basic idea is to find the best parameters of the hypothesis according to the data set, so as to determine the best hypothesis. Here, we need to use the square error cost function and use the gradient descent to reduce the cost function.

### The method of building neural network
  It's hard to generalize this in a few words, so here I'm going to talk about one thing that impressed me.  
  * Complete the calculation in the form of matrix   
    In this way, a group of data, even tens of thousands of data, can be calculated only once. It's really efficient!
