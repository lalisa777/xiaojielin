# FINAL PROJECT - FAI PLATFORM
My original plan was to build a movie recommendation engine, but with the gradual in-depth understanding of recommendation engine, I found that many people have done recommendation system before, and all kinds of methods are involved, even this has become a common module in machine learning. For me, a beginner of mechanical learning, it is not difficult to learn how to build a recommendation system, as long as I am willing to spend time and energy, but it is still difficult to optimize and innovate algorithms.  

#### So in the end, I made the FAI PLATFORM based on my learning of recommendation engine.

#### This is a website that the public can understand and learn mechanical learning.

### CONCEPT

We are all AI explorers in this age. The emergence of artificial intelligence has changed our life. I build this FAI platform so that everyone can better understand AI. This is a place where people can learn and progress together.
