The function of the diode: When stopping supplying energy to the motor,it will continue to spin, because it has inertia. When it’s spinning, it will generate a voltage in the opposite direction than the right current. This reverse voltage can damage transistor. So a diode in parallel with the motor, so that the back voltage will pass through the diode. The diode will only allow electric-ity to flow in one direction, protecting the rest of the circuit.
   

*  PWM controls motor speed

     This lab has 2 buttons. One is used to speed up the motor, another is to slow down the motor.

     Through the buttons to change the electrical level of pin, and the change the electrical level of pin can control the change of duty cycle, so that the load voltage will be changedand which can change the motor speed. 
     
     The longer the pulse width is, the larger the duty cycle will be, and the larger voltage will be provided to the motor, so higher the motor speed is. 
     
     On the contrary, the shorter the pulse width is, the smaller the duty cycle will be, so the smaller voltage will be provided to the motor, and the lower the motor speed is.
