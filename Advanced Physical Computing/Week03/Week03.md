## Playing with fades

I typed the code myself, and simply made a litte difference to let the LED turn on at the begining.

## Making a dark LED

After building this project, I have a better u derstanding of transistor.

From my presective, the function of the transistor can be regarded as "amplification", since it is interesting that the transistor can control the cuurent by a tiny jolt of electricity. I mean that the transistor can "amplify" the change of a tiny jolt of electricity to control the whole current.

In this project, the voltage of A is the of great importance. When the base of the transisitor detects the voltage of A is over 0.6V. The transisitor will turn into connected state, and the LED will turn on. The change of voltage of A is related to the phototransistor. When light falls on the phototransistor, reverse current flows which is proportional to the luminance. The photons from striking light activate the phototransistor so that the voltage changes.

* My understanding of phototransistor

The on-off of phototransistor is controlled by illumination. If the phototransistor is under the positive voltage, whether there is light or not, the transistor is all on, which loses its meaning. If the phototransistor is on under the reverse voltage, the transistor is on under the light and off under the no light condition, its working significance is realized.

no light - less reverse current in the phototransistor - more resistor in the phototransistor- more voltage at A point (>0.6v)- activate the transistor

light - more reverse current in the phototransistor - less resistor in the phototransistor- less voltage at A point (<0.6v)- can not activate the transistor
