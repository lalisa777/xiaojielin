* Complete the Lower Layer of the Hexagon (LED)

Connect all the positive poles together, so does the negative poles.
Since the positions of these 24 LEDs are special, it is difficult to connect them all at once. So I first cut off the two pin pins of the led and connected the LEDs with the cut out parts.
Before cutting it off, I painted all the negative poles in yellow to distinguish them.

This step took me a long, long time. Since Each hexagon has 24 LEDs and I got 9 hexagons, which means that I have a total of 216 LEDs to solder.

* Complete the Upper Layer of the Hexagon (diamond)

At first, I planned to use fibers for the upper decoration. I even bought 15000 meters of fish line. But I tried many methods, binding with a rubber band and sticking directly with glue … scattered fibers are always difficult to fix in the holes of hexagon. Fibers keep falling off.

So in the end, I decided to use diamond. Since using diamond as mirror can express that we are as precious as diamond. So, the concept is “Take a step back to see ourselves more clearly, and we will find that we are all as precious as diamonds”.

Glue the diamonds one by one. It’s still a long time since there are 216 diamonds.

* Assemble the Upper and Lower Layers 

Stick on support at the side and connect upper and lower layers.

It is how it looks like when it has been finished.

* Fix Photodiode

In the center of the two-layer hexagon, I have reserved a place for the photodiode. Pass the photodiode, connect the other end to the wire, and connect it to the circuit.

* Finish the Shell 

Due to the limitations of laser engraving, only a small piece can be carved, otherwise the entire carving is too wasteful of material.

Use acrylic adhesive to stick each small piece together.

* Finally Completed
