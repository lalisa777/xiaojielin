## Playing with fades

## Making a dark LED
After building this project, I have a better u derstanding of transistor.

From my presective, the function of the transistor can be regarded as "amplification". Since it is interesting that the transistor can control the cuurent by a tiny jolt of electricity.

In this project, the voltage of A is the of great importance. When the base of the transisitor detects the voltage of A is over 0.6V. The transisitor will turn into connected state, and the LED will turn on. The change of voltage of A is related to the phototransistor. When light falls on the phototransistor, reverse current flows which is proportional to the luminance.
